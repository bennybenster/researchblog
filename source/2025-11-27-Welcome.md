## Hello
This is the first 'post' I am putting up. Everything here is intended to be reflective and work in progress. It's about personal accountability rather than accessibility. Sorry if you came here expecting something else. 

Just to check my citations work, I should note that: @braunThematicAnalysisPractical2022 [] is the main text I am using
