## Welcome!

This is the first 'post' I am putting up. Everything here is intended to
be reflective and work in progress. It's about personal accountability
rather than accessibility. Sorry if you came here expecting something
else.

Just to check my citations work, I should note that: Braun & Clarke
(2022) is the main text I am using

:::: {#refs .references .csl-bib-body .hanging-indent entry-spacing="0" line-spacing="2"}
::: {#ref-braunThematicAnalysisPractical2022 .csl-entry}
Braun, V., & Clarke, V. (2022). *Thematic analysis: A practical guide*.
