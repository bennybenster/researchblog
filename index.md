## Welcome to my personal research space.

The plan is to document ideas-in-progress, reflections on pre-sessional teaching and academic research, and anything else I feel like discussing. The goals for setting up this space are:

- Personal accountability: I want to share and update work in progress to give me small regular tasks that can keep me 'in my research zone' and hopefully minimise procrastination (or it might just be a different kind of procrastination).
- Open research: I believe that research should be open, freely available and transparent.
- Explicit, not implicit: I believe that when people present finished research, this hides the struggles and reality of trying to 'be' academic.
