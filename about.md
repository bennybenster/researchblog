I'm Ben, an Associate Lecturer at UCL focusing on materials development for our [CLIE Pre-sessional Course](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/languages-international-education/preparation-courses/pre-sessional-english-courses).

I am also a part-time student, which is why I started this page. I am studying at the University of St. Andrews, and through my Doctoral Studies (to become a [Doctor of Professional Practice](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/tesol/)), I have set myself the ambitious goal of completing qualitative work with students and teachers that is practice focused. 

That is, my ultimate goal is to use research projects and methods to improve the quality of the course in terms of teaching and learning, as well as the student and teacher experience. I have doubts (every day) about whether this is a challenge too far for me, but they haven't kicked me out yet!
