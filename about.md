I'm Ben, an Associate Lecturer at UCL focusing on materials development for our [CLIE Pre-sessional Course](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/languages-international-education/preparation-courses/pre-sessional-english-courses){:target="_blank"}.

I am also a part-time student, which is why I started this page. I am studying at the University of St. Andrews, and through my Doctoral Studies (to become a [Doctor of Professional Practice](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/tesol/tesol-dprof-september-and-january/){:target="_blank"}), I have set myself the ambitious goal of completing qualitative work with students and teachers that is practice focused. 

I hope to use research projects and methods to improve the quality of the pre-sessional course in terms of teaching and learning, as well as the student and teacher experience. My particular interest is in how students write a short essay from sources. I have doubts (every day) about whether this is a challenge too far for me.
